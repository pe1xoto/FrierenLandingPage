## 📝 About The Project

I created this landing page project for "Frieren" using only **HTML, CSS, vanilla JavaScript,** and the **GSAP** library for animations. The entire design was made by me in Figma.

**⚠️ Important Viewing Note:**

This project is not very responsive, I kinda got lazy about fixing it. It was developed on a **1920x1080 (16:9)** monitor and is best viewed at a **1920x911** resolution.

Maybe I'll get around to fixing the responsiveness issues someday!
